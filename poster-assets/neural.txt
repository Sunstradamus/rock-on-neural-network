Introduction
In the field of computer vision, machine learning techniques and their applications have recently become popular.
We wanted to experiment with the effectiveness of convolutional neural networks for the use in classification/object recognition
over a traditional method such as Scale-invariant feature transform. In our experiments, we apply the use of a convolutional neural
network in order to classify and recognize the gestures used in the simple game of Rock, Paper, Scissors. This involves training the
network to be able to classify the input images into one of the 3 classes Rock, Paper, or Scissors.

Approach
Our approach for building our convolutional neural network is to to start with a baseline network to see what the results we can get from
the start. From then on we can branch out and tweak with different network structures and hyperparameters to see how far we can improve
it to get better results. 

We will base our approach by using the pretrained Inception V3 network as the base for what we will build upon
in a technique called transfer learning. This allows us to take advantage of an already powerful fully trained classification model that
we can use to retrain for a new set of classes. We can get pretty decent results out of the box this way which will cut down on the amount
of work needed to train a completely new network from scratch.

Our training data set consists of 215 training images and 196 validation images. For each network that we produce, we will train each one
for 300 epochs using all 215 training and 196 validation images per epoch. Each network can then be benchmarked to see if improvements were
made in terms of accuracy and validation accuracy and we can choose the one with the best results are our network of choice.
