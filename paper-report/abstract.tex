Recent advances in GPU hardware have resulted in more powerful computational
processing power at extremely low costs. This lowered barrier to entry allows
for neural networks to be trained on modern low-to-mid range PCs. This provides
an efficient and accurate means for classifying even the most niche of datasets,
such as hand gestures in the children's game of Rock-Paper-Scissors. In this
article, we conduct a systematic analysis of the performance of state-of-the-
art computer vision algorithms compared against a pre-trained convolutional
neural network. We also discuss the advantages and drawbacks of both approaches
and note the challenges of both techniques.
