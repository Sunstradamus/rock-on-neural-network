\section{Performance}
\label{performance}

In this section, we discuss the real-world performance obtained by running the SIFT detection algorithm as described in section~\ref{sift} and the neural network as described in section~\ref{neural_network}. We chose a relatively old, mid-range laptop to run the tests on as it was the machine that we intended to use for our demo during the poster session. The laptop was a 2012 Macbook equipped with a <CPU>, <RAM>, <GFX>, running on <MAC OS darwin???>.

[WIP] The SIFT gesture detector was able to run in real-time, although it only had an accuracy of 53.57\%.
